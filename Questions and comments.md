# Questions and comments



# 1.



### b) 

Should be double checked. Are the expected value and variance supposed to be functions of **X**?

### c)

ii. False? Or?

### d)

**TO DO**: Justify choice of BIC as criterium. (BIC places higher penalty on complexity than Cp/AIC, I think that may be appropriate here.) Explain idea behind BIC briefly.

### e)

Should explain what lambda.1se is. 

Do we need some type of plot here?

### b) 

Which tree-based model should one choose here?

I chose random forest, but I'm not sure if this is the best choice. Would be nice to add some more discussion and reasons why random forest is appropriate. Would especially be nice to have arguments connected to the specific problem/dataset that we are applying it to.

(When fitting all the tree-based methods we have been using in the course, the random forest gave the lowest MSE, however I did not tune the parameters in the boosting model.)

### c) 

**TO DO:** Compare all methods in problems 1-3.

### b)

What reasons do we have to prefer one linear kernel over radial kernel or vice versa? The linear kernel performs slightly better on the test set, but are there any other considerations to make?

**TO DO:** Add more explanation.

### c)
I picked logistic regression. There might be a better choice.

**TO DO:** Compare chosen method to SVMs. Elaborate on interpretation of results.

### d) 
Not sure about these.

### e) 
Not done. A bit unsure about how to do this.

Hint from lecturer: Deviance is -2log(likelihood).
